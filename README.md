This thing is not properly tested and is not approved by Duke. Use at your own risk.

## Description
This script is for automating the course registration process at Duke University through Dukehub. It only hits the enroll button, so make sure your courses are in your shopping cart prior running the script.
Note that you NEED a yubikey registered with Duke MFA to make this work.

## How to run
1. Register your yubikey on Duke MFA and keep it plugged in.
2. Open `secret.txt` and replace the placeholders with your netid, password in plaintext, and the OTP generated by your yubikey
   The OTP is generated by touching the gold contact on your yubikey (it acts like a keyboard). Note that using a OTP will invalidate all prior OTPs generated by the same yubikey, and it might have a expiration time, so do this before you go to bed.
3. Modify `automate.py` on line 76 (too lazy to setup another config file) to use your registration window start time (7AM for example)
4. Install the dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`
5. Download chromedriver [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) and move it under your `$PATH`
6. Turn off screen saver
7. Run the script before you go to bed and leave the computer running
